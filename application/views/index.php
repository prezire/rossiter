			<p>Our primary motivation of the group is to help as many people who need financial support as much as possible.

			<h2>Ethical Company - What is our solution?</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="title_description">
			<p>We aspire to bridge the gap between the benefactors, ethical companies and the NGO through our unified donations platform. 

			Digital Lifeline aspires to address the problem through our unique system via features such as: 
			<ul>
				<li><kbd>Open API</kbd> for digital assets donation.</li>
				<li><kbd>Case Management System</kbd> for NGOs to help them keep track of their cases by providing them a dashboard for easy tracking of which case needs to be funded ASAP, which of the cases are to be next in line for donations, how many people have donated, how much money was raised per case and such.</li>
				<li>Extensive social awareness through a single-click-share and broadcast system. Now NGOs would no longer have to post the same details over and over again across different platforms. Build the details for a particular case and choose on which platforms you want to share it with <kbd>will it be a feed on Twitter, a share on Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+ and much more</kbd>.</li></p>

			<h2>Benefactor - What Is The Impact To Society?</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="title_description">
			<p>We revolutionize the way people donate. Now donations do not have to be accessible to people who have bank accounts and can easily wire money or people who have Paypal and credit cards. Now people of virtually all ages and social ranks will be able to share and donate through SMS or the Facebook credits that were left unused or the Zynga points accumulated by playing online.<br /><br />

			Benefactors would have a single platform to visit and collaborate with different NGOs.<br /><br />

			NGOs would be able to streamline their process and raise awareness at the same time with less hassle and with guarantee that it delivers.<br /><br /></p>
